		challenge. Here&#39;s some things I learned that helped me manage my time better.</p> <h3 class="text-lg font-medium svelte-1nvumra">Define &quot;good&quot;</h3> <p class="svelte-1nvumra">The first step to fixing bad time management is defining what good time management looks like.
		In high school, I wanted to:</p> <ol class="indent-16 svelte-1nvumra"><li>a) Spend the minimum amount of time on studying to get good grades (≥96)</li> <li>b) Fulfill my responsibilities in school clubs (computer science club, math club)</li> <li>c) Spend lots of time on extracurriculars</li> <li>d) Spend lots of time on coding projects</li> <li>e) Sleep ≥8 hours a day</li> <li>f) Still have some time to exercise, socialize, and have fun</li></ol> <p class="svelte-1nvumra">In university, my goals are similar but different.</p> <ol class="indent-16 svelte-1nvumra"><li>a) Spend the minimum amount of time on studying to get decent grades (≥80)</li> <li>a) Spend lots of time applying to jobs, polishing my resume</li> <li>d) Spend lots of time on coding projects</li> <li>f) Regularly exercise, socialize, and have fun</li> <li>e) Sleep ≥8 hours a day</li></ol> <p class="svelte-1nvumra">I believe that listing down your goals immediately makes them more achievable. After all, you
		can&#39;t succeed at anything if you don&#39;t have a clear definition of what success looks like!</p> <h3 class="text-lg font-medium svelte-1nvumra">Analyzing the difference</h3> <p class="svelte-1nvumra">So, you&#39;ve decided what &quot;good&quot; time management looks like. Take the time to analyze the
		difference between the quality (or lack thereof) of your current time management and your goal.</p> <p class="svelte-1nvumra">If you often feel like you don&#39;t even know where your time is going, (or simply don&#39;t want to
		admit it), try tracking your screen time usage (because, after all, that&#39;s likely where all your
		time is going).</p> <p class="svelte-1nvumra">Spending too much time on Instagram and Reddit?</p> <p class="svelte-1nvumra">Spending too much time on gaming?</p> <p class="svelte-1nvumra">Spending too much time on... something else that isn&#39;t productive?</p>`;return{c(){e=o("section"),e.innerHTML=a,this.h()},l(t){e=m(t,"SECTION",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),r(e)!=="svelte-13a6728"&&(e.innerHTML=a),this.h()},h(){c(e,"class","px-4 pb-8 leading-relaxed centered-content")},m(t,s){u(t,e,s)},p:i,i,o:i,d(t){t&&d(e)}}}class y extends g{constructor(e){super(),h(this,e,null,p,l,{})}}export{y as component};
